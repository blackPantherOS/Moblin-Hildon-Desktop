Description: network management framework (GNOME frontend)
 NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all
 times. It is intended only for the desktop use-case, and is not intended for
 usage on servers. The point of NetworkManager is to make networking
 configuration and setup as painless and automatic as possible.  If using DHCP,
 NetworkManager is _intended_ to replace default routes, obtain IP addresses
 from a DHCP server, and change nameservers whenever it sees fit.
 .
 This package contains a systray applet for GNOME's notification area but it
 also works for other desktop environments which provide a systray like KDE
 or XFCE.
 It displays the available networks and allows to easily switch between them.
 For encrypted networks it will prompt the user for the key/passphrase and it
 can optionally store them in the gnome-keyring.
