midbrowser (0.3.0b2d~mt1ubuntu11) gaston; urgency=low

  * Changed the preference "general.useragent.extra.firefox" to "Firefox/3.0 beta". This fixes
    the rendering issues with sites that check for browser and version (i.e. mail.live.com).

    fixes bug #186556 (image cannot be magnified using the zoom in/out button).

    fix the rendering issues found in http://www.miniclip.com.
