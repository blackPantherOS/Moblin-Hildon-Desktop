Overview of Marquee Plugins
----------------------------
This package contains all of the plugins for the marquee (bar at the top of 
the UI).  It includes the following:
  Application menu, navigation buttons, clock, close button
These are Hildon TaskNavigatorItem-derived plugins.  For each plugin in this 
package a library and .desktop file are created.  The 
/etc/hildon-desktop/marquee.conf file contains the list of plugins in the 
order they are displayed on the screen.  Unfortunately right now the Marquee 
uses a GtkHBox to contain the plugins, so everything is packed left.  This 
means that each plugin has to be correctly sized so that they all layout in 
the rigth position.  A nice change would be to add support for a 
GtkFixed-derived class for the Marquee so that the location and size of each 
plugin would be independent.

We would love help creating new, useful, and innovative plugins for the 
marquee.  Things such as quick-launch or such have been discussed but not 
planned.  The existing plugins could also use plenty of love.  We also need to create a plugin for the statusbar.  The existing statusbar plugin is just a 
space holder for now.  The real statusbar is implemented elsewhere (hack).  
Finally, none of the plugins do a good job of showing user interaction yet 
(the buttons don't change image when clicked, for example).
