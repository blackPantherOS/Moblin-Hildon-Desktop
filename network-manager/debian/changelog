        (LP: #137744).
  * debian/patches/41r_wpa_control_custom_timeout.patch: add a state timeout
       to wpa control Private struct and add functions to set/unset this custom
       timeout; in turn implement this feature and make wpa_ctrl obey this
       custom timeout.
  * debian/patches/41r_wpa_control_explicit_TIMEOUT_reply_fixup.patch: wpa_ctrl
       returns bogus reply string which may lead to access of not-initialized
       memory in case an operation times out. We fix this by explicitly setting
       reply to TIMEOUT[CLI] on wpa_ctrl side before returning.
  * debian/patches/41s_wpa_ctrl_socket_non_block.patch: setup wpa_ctrl_socket as
       a real NON_BLOCK socket to prevent one potential reason for stale states
       in network-manager (deadlocks).
  * debian/patches/41t_nm_device_wireless_index_ctrl_sockets_by_run_count.patch:
       to prevent new supplicant sockets to not conflict with sockets that might
       still exist from previous run we now append a run_count index to _all_
       socket control paths. This run_count is incremented in supplicant_cleanup
       and is mod 10 to prevent any overflow when having more than 32-bit runs.
  * debian/patches/41q_retry_supplicant_cleanup_startup_if_ctrl_interface_connect_failes.patch:
       another try to terminate wpasupplicant more graceful: new shutdown
       sequence sends disable_network, ap_scan 0, interface_remove, terminate.
  * debian/patches/41u_custom_timeout_for_some_wpa_ctrl_operations.patch: we now
       use a custom timeout for ctrl operations: INTERFACE_ADD, DISABLE_NETWORK,
       TERMINATE; we take care that this timeout is unset after operations are
       through.
  * debian/patches/series: add all these great new patches to quilt _series_.
  * debian/patches/41d_ipw3945_turn_off_essid_in_stage1.patch,
      41l_enable_ipw3945_reset_essid.patch,series: drop from patchset - because
      we have a real fix in ipw3945 driver now.

      dropping the patches above.

network-manager (0.6.4-6ubuntu7) feisty; urgency=low

  * 21_manual_means_always_online.diff:
    The previous version of this patch (ubuntu5) made a change to nm-applet
    that would assume the state was disconnected if the device list was empty.
    This didn't work since the device list is always empty on start because
    the status is obtained first.

    This was guarding against having the connected state with no devices,
    which broke later assertions.  Change the patch to correct those
    assertions instead; a connected state with no active device will now
    display the wired icon with a "Manual network configuration" tooltip.

    LP: #82335, #105234.

  * 05-debian_backend.patch:
    Revert change in ubuntu3 that commented out the blacklisting of
    devices listed in /etc/network/interfaces with more exotic configuration
    than just inet dhcp.  This was done by the above patch in ubuntu5, it
    seems silly to do it there, better to do it in the original patch.

  * 22_manual_config_available_when_connected.patch:
    Display the "Manual configuration" menu option when we have no devices,
    but are connected; since that means some number of blacklisted devices
    exist.  Don't display the "No network devices" message in that case.

network-manager (0.6.4-6ubuntu4) feisty; urgency=low

  * /etc/network/interfaces can have more than one instance of the same
    interface. For example:

    iface eth0 inet dhcp
    and later
    iface eth0 inet6 static

    The function ifparser_getif is capable only to return the first instance
    of eth0 that is a legal entry for NM to take over, but NM still does not
    know how to handle what's next.

    Patch 19_interfaces_can_have_more_than_one_instance.patch creates a sub
    list of linked if_block via nextsame, binding together all if_block's
    related to the same interface and preserving if_data for each block.

    Patch 20_do_not_take_over_dhcpv4iface_when_v6_is_configured.patch
    blacklist interfaces that have dhcp for inet configuration but have an
    inet6 entry following later on. NM does not know yet how to
    store/restore/configure IPv6 (blacklisted too) so for now we tell NM
    to keep the hands off these interfaces.

network-manager (0.6.3-2ubuntu7) feisty; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/00upstream-ftbfs.patch:
    - Fix dbus version check in src/NetworkManagerDbus.c to work with dbus
      1.0.
    - src/nm-netlink-monitor.c: Standard fix for new if_addr.h world order.
    - These issues are already fixed in the currently pending Debian merge, so
      this patch can go away soon.
  * Add debian/patches/13_avahi-autoipd.patch:
    - src/nm-device.c: Do not use the internal get_autoip() function, but
      instead check if avahi-autoipd was engaged for the interface and do not
      meddle with the settings in that case. This is in accordance with
      upstream who wants to completely throw away the internal IPv4LL code.
    - src/dhcp-manager/nm-dhcp-manager.c: Raise DHCP timeout from 45 seconds
      to 99 seconds, thus effectively disabling it. We want to use
      dhclient.conf's timeout configuration; if that happens to be longer, we
      interrupt dhclient while it's still working and get confused if the IP
      suddenly changes underneath us.
    - src/dhcp-manager/nm-dhcp-manager.c: Treat DHCDBD_FAIL like
      DHCDBD_TIMEOUT, i. e. continue with stage 4 of device activation
      (IPv4LL address assignment) instead of giving up and trying all over
      again. Since dhcdbd calls dhclient in single-shot mode (-1), it will
      never return with TIMEOUT, only with FAILURE, and we want to go into
      zeroconf mode instead of being stuck in an endless retry loop.
    - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZeroConfNetworking for details.

    - use at_console="true" instead of netdev,
    - retain rml's workarounds patch,
    - retain j's hostap patch.

network-manager (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * More integration work. (Closes: #355244)
    - Added network-manager-dispatcher.script and
      06-dispatch_more_events.patch.
      This way the scripts in /etc/networks/if-*.d/ are called properly by
      NetworkManagerDispatcher.
      Thanks to the Ubuntu devs for this work!
    - Added 08-disabled_devices.patch. Network interfaces listed in
      /etc/network/interfaces which are not configured "auto" and "dhcp" are
      not handled by NM. This makes it possible to configure interfaces 
      statically and have NM not messing with them. 
      Updated README.Debian to reflect these changes.
    - Added 09-nm_bad_mutex_free.patch. Otherwise NM crashes if a device is
      disabled.
  * Added 07-libnm_glib_reconnect_dbus.patch which makes libnm_glib sleep 
    between unsuccessful connection attempts to dbus. (Closes: #366010)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no further changes required.
  * Removed *.la files from the dev packages as we also ship pkg-config files
    which are a better alternative.
  * Added 10-interface_parser_fixes.patch which fixes several problems with
    the /etc/network/interfaces parser. (Closes: #355564)

    anymore.
  * The wpa_supplicant binary was moved from /usr/sbin to /sbin. Updated
    debian/rules accordingly.
  * Added dependency on hal (Closes: #356622)
  * Added autostart file to network-manager-gnome. This way nm-applet is
    started automatically on login.
