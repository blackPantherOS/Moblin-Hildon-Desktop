TODO items for NetworkManager
-----------------------------

Any of these items are of course fair game for anyone, patches are greatly
welcome.  It also serves as a "what still needs to be done" list.


- Access Point link checking thresholds

Wireless link checking could be enhanced to check the signal strength of an
access point and switch if the current access point a wireless card is
associated with has dropped below say, 20%.


- Support 40/64 bit passphrases

Allow user to enter passphrases and convert them to 40/64 bit WEP keys on the
fly.  Unfortunately, the algorithm for 40/64 bit passphrases is kind of messy.
