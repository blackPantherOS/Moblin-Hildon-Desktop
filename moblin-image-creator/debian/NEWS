moblin-image-creator (0.30) gutsy; urgency=low

  * This version of image-creator only supports lpia platforms and is
    incompatible with projects created with previous versions.  It's
    recommended that you delete your projects' chroots as returned by:
       grep ^PATH= /usr/share/pdk/projects/*.proj
    and then delete the /usr/share/pdk/projects/*.proj files which are still
    using a non-lpia PLATFORM.
