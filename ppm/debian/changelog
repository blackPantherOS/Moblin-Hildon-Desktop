ppm (0.1) gaston; urgency=low

  [ Mohamed Abbas <mohomad.abbas@intel.com> ]
  * Apply Zhao, Fan patch to fix setting screensaver with value 0
  * Add new functions to Power Policy manager dbus interface.
    The added function is deactivate modes.
    ppmtool is changed to allow to do set, append and deactivate.
  * change maxperformance to max in all layers files, cpu plugin
    support max values only

  [ Sarah Sharp <sarah.a.sharp@intel.com> ]
  * Remove device field from plugin messages
  * Added README
  * Added command-line option to activate modes.
  * Ignores invalid modes (ones that don't match any available modes).
    Need to check about activating invisible modes. Right now it will
    probably activate them, which we may not want the user to do. May want
    to put ifdef's around code so that it's only compiled in when the testing
    make target is run.
  * Added a small test plugin.
  * The test plugin simply sends received commands to a log file.
    Note that this plugin will fail if ppmd is not run as root
    (since the log file is in /var/log).
  * Update test plugin for new API.
  * Renamed policies directory to layers.
  * Reorganized plugin directory and makefiles.
  * Made makefiles use standard installation directories.
    See sections DESTDIR and "Variables for Installation Directories" in the GNU coding standards at
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html
  * Generate config.h that points to install dirs.
  * Factored out the test plugin logfile.
    Make the build fail if targets fail.
  * Add dependancy checking to compilation.
    This will force a recompile if a .h file changes.
    For some odd reason, this redoes the dependancy files if you type make twice in a row.
    After that, it says there is nothing to do.
    This is still better than the old system.
  * Change dbus interface of PPM to support struct.
    Added new function to append modes to PPM daemon
  * Initial testing code commit.
  * Suppress as much output to stdout when running in background.
    Still gets some output from the display plugin.
  * Changed find_layer to find_mode.
  * Generate ppmd.service and fix dbus files' uninstall.

  [ Rusty Lynch <rusty.lynch@intel.com> ]
  * Initial debianization
  * Fixing a bug that caused all radio's to be turned off when the policy
    specifically asked to allow radio usage.
  * Fixup the debian changlog file
  * Fixing bug in debian packaging build and runtime deps
  * Add debian specific init script
  * cutting a gaston release
