udev (111-0ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - many bug fixes,
    - ACTION!="add|change" now works as expected.

  * Enable the upstream rule_generator extra, and include the rules for both
    CD aliases and network devices.  These generate rules files for each new
    piece of unique hardware discovered, giving a consistent name thereafter.

    ie. if you add a new network card, it is assigned the next eth* number,
    and will have that number every single time you boot.  Likewise a new
    CD writer would get the next free cdrw* symlink, and keep that symlink
    forever.
  * Drop hard-coded cdrom/cdrw/dvd/dvdrw symlinks.
  * Install additional udev.finish script at rcS.d/S23, so it runs after
    mtab and updates the existing rules files.

  * 80-extras-iftab_helper.patch: Drop this patch since we're now using the
    upstream persistent net rule generator rather than requiring users to
    hand-maintain /etc/iftab.
  * 70-rename-netif-increment.patch: Drop this patch, was an obscure iftab
    feature that we're deprecating.
  * 25-iftab.rules; Drop rules file that calls the iftab_helper.

  * 60-mknod-symlink-races.patch: New patch that repeats the call to mknod()
    or symlink() as long as it fails because something already exists, and
    we haven't failed to remove anything first.

  * 90-persistent-dm-md.patch: Drop this patch, instead we maintain persistent
    symlinks for devmapper and mdadm devices in a separate rules file
    shipped with those packages.

  * 40-permissions.rules: place mmc and pcmcia block devices in the plugdev
    group, EPSON scsi devices in the scanner group and scsi media changer
    devices in the tape group.
  * 90-modprobe.rules: load the osst module for Onstream ADR* tape devices,
    load the ch module for SCSI media changer devices.

udev (108-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - many bug fixes,
    - DRIVER== will now only match devices that have a real driver.
    - SYMLINKs may now have per-device priorities specified with
      OPTIONS="link_priority=100", removal of a device means that the symlink
      will be changed to point at the device with the next highest priority.
    - dasd_id removed from the tree

  * 10-suppress-syslog.patch: patch from Ian Jackson to add an option to
    udevd to suppress the logging of messages with syslog.
  * 80-extras-watershed.patch: take Ian's watershed utility that he added
    directly to the upstream source, and split off into a proper patch of
    its own.
  * 90-persistent-dm-md.patch: create persistent storage links for devmapper
    and mdadm devices, running these rules whenever a change event occurs
    LP: #75681.
  * 90-skip-whole-disk.patch: renumber to 91-skip-whole-disk.patch

  * Move the rule to name devmapper devices using dmsetup into the dmsetup
    package, and from there to a correct 25-dmsetup.rules name.  This
    shouldn't have been mixed in with the persistent symlinks code.

  * Change the permission-applying rules to use ATTRS instead of ATTR.
    LP: #75753.
  * Move 50-cdrom_id.rules to 30-cdrom_id.rules.  LP: #75753.
  * Fixed /dev/pilot rule to use ATTRS instead of ATTR.  LP: #89687.

  * Drop the rules that used grepmap to parse modules.ccwmap and
    modules.inputmap, since these modules now use modules.alias
  * Drop dependency on grepmap.

  * Decrease minimum kernel version to 2.6.17, after some testing we can
    confirm that the rules we ship with work there.

  * Update the standard prep_/undo_/rm_/mv_/conffile functions to take
    into account current dpkg behaviour wrt obsolete conffiles.  The conffile
    is now moved out of the way in preinst and the moved conffile either
    deleted or moved into its new location in postinst; in postrm we move
    the conffile back to its original name.

    This means that the conffile is not present with its original name when
    dpkg configures the new versiom, so is not left in the conffile list as
    obsolete.
  * Purge backups of modified obsolete conffiles when the package is purged.

  * New upstream release:
    - %e enumeration removed.

    - Most keys renamed (see RELEASE-NOTES).
    - Direct writing to sysfs attributes now supported.

  * Update patches:

      merged upstream and we don't need most of it anymore.
    - 45-udevtrigger-sort.patch: dropped, merged upstream.

    - 70-ifrename.patch: largely merged upstream, keep support for "eth*"
      incrementing in 70-rename-netif-increment.patch.

  * Simplify the initramfs handling somewhat.  We now just trigger
    everything, and don't wait for things to settle; instead relying on the
    loop in mountroot() which will do exactly the right thing,
  * Use pkill instead of shell /proc iteration to kill udevd.  Ubuntu #65711.

  * Drop most WAIT_FOR_SYSFS rules, increase kernel requirement to 2.6.19.
  * Rework rules file to newer attributes and naming.  Drop some symlinks
    where they are not part of devices.txt and no other distribution

  * Fixed typo (PREREQS -> PREREQ) in initramfs hook, purely cosmetic
    and didn't cause any problems.  Ubuntu: #36962.
  * Provide /dev/video and /dev/radio symlinks for compatibility with
    older software.  Ubuntu: #36860
    - as with all /dev symlinks, there's no guarantee which device they'll
      point to if you have multiple devices.  This is not considered a bug,
      software should be modified to use HAL and present a list of available
      devices rather than rely on symlinks.
  * Changed udevplug to write "add" to the uevent file, instead of a silly
    string; future kernel versions may support multiple commands.

  * Split the initramfs script out even more, instead of a case statement
    in init-premount move the module loading to local-top and nfs-top.
    This fixes the long-standing bug where changing boot= on the kernel
    command line has no effect.
  * Drop the "|| true"s from usplash_write calls, infinity says they're
    unnecessary.

  * Place joysticks in the "plugdev" group, for programs that access the
    joystick device directly and not through X.  Ubuntu: #33354.
  * The storage device enumerator used by the installer was a bit too
    efficient; it would generate new symlink names every time an add event
    for a device was received.  The installer causes many add events to occur,
    each time hw-detect and the partitioner is run.  Fix the script to
    return an existing symlink name if one exists in the udevdb.
    Ubuntu: #27926.
  * Fix iftab_helper segmentation fault when /etc/iftab doesn't exist,
    caused by returning NULL rather than the suggested name; now returns
    whatever name the kernel gave.  Ubuntu: #34078.

    properly.  Ubuntu: #32679.
  * Hard-code the location of usplash_write and call directly, as
    we don't have "type" in busybox.  This corrects usplash timing out
    early while waiting for SCSI root filesystem to show up.  Ubuntu: #28357.

    SORECVBUFFORCE patch.
  
  * As the ifrename patch generally seems to be working, drop the "_clashed"
    moniker and instead just use the next free interface number available to
    us.  So instead of eth0_clashed, you'll see e.g. eth2 now.  If you wanted
    it as eth0, you need to change your /etc/iftab file.

  * Log the results of performing the udevplug to /dev/.udev.log by using
    udevmonitor.  This log file will be moved to /var/log/udev later in the
    boot sequence.  Note that this won't work if /usr is on a separate

    - after renaming to the temporary interface name, make sure we copy
      that into ifr_name otherwise we'll be trying to rename the interface
      we've just renamed.  Ubuntu #31040.
    - use "OLDNAME_ifrename" as the temporary name rather than "__NEWNAME"
      to avoid clashes and just generally make it more obvious.
    - use "NAME_clashed" as the iftab clash name rather than "_NAME" to make
      it more obvious
    - don't write an initial /etc/iftab on install or upgrade; leave it to
      the installer.

  "Dancing freaks and sycophants, Westwood heels and shoulder pads."

  * Rework the initramfs premount script a little to try and make the root
    filesystem order a little more predictable.  In particular make sure we
    don't load USB/firewire/etc. drivers until we've loaded IDE and SCSI
    drivers otherwise sda could be won by a fast USB key over your SATA
    root filesystem.  Ubuntu #28150, #30418.
  
  * Include support for renaming of network interfaces.  This is done with
    a new iftab_helper that can parse a subset of the ifrename /etc/iftab
    file and return the expected name of the network interface.  This is
    called from a udev rule that uses the internal support for network
    interface renaming.  Interface swapping is supported both by renaming
    network interfaces that would clash with one specified in the file and
    by waiting for an interface name to become free in udev itself.

    Ubuntu #28654, #30377.
  * Load mmc_block when an mmc device is inserted; will improve once
    we get a way to determine exactly which mmc sub-module we need, but
    this will give us out-of-the-box SD/MMC card support for now.

  "You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic."

  * New upstream release:
    - %e (enumerate) in rules has been deprecated.
    - event environment now lists symlinks to device in DEVLINKS variable
    - device-mapper support for persistent disk rules
  * Dropped 10-udev-conf.patch, now included upstream.
  * Dropped 02-no-sepol.patch, as we now depend on that.
  * Added 10-selinux-include-udev-h.patch to fix build failure with selinux.
  * Increased versioned dependency on libselinux1-dev to that which includes
    matchpathcon_init_prefix.

  * Fixed dvb device naming to create correct format names, bugs in both
    udev rules to match the device and program to generate the right names.
    Ubuntu #20874.
  * Fixed a bug in udevplug that caused it to wait for an event to complete
    that it never tickled.  Ubuntu #20943.
  * Included firmware loading in the udeb so network cards needing firmware
    will work in the installer.  Ubuntu #20993
  * Plug devices in serial during the initramfs, provides a little more
    predictability of device names of the root filesystem.

  * Rule changes:
    - wait for the address attribute of network devices to appear in sysfs
      before processing.
      Rationale: solves race not yet fixed in kernel.
    - dropped %e from symlink rules; this means you will only have one
      /dev/cdrom symlink no matter how many devices you have - and it isn't
      necessarily predictable which one it is.  Software should use HAL or
      similar to present "human names" for devices, and sysadmins should
      use the /dev/disk/* names.
      Rationale: upstream.
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/65-persistent.rules renamed to 65-persistent-disk.rules
      Rationale: upstream.
    - place /dev/nvram in the nvram group.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #21571 and breezy.
    - load sg module for all SCSI devices.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #12434, SuSE rules.
    - place SCSI processors (SYSFS{type}==3) from HP in the scanner group.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #12434.
    - change permissions of removable devices (floppies, usb, ieee1394, etc.)
      to 0660 (the default) instead of overriding it down to 0640.
      Rationale: allows formatting of the media, and the groups are intended
      to imply physical access anyway.

  * Rework the initramfs premount script.  Instead of trying to do the same
    steps for everything, take different paths depending on the values of
    $BOOT and $ROOT.
    - BOOT=nfs means we only load network card drivers.
    - BOOT=local means we look at ROOT, if it's an ide device we might need
      to load ide-generic if probing the bus doesn't create it; if it's a
      scsi or sata device we might need to wait around for a bit for the
      device to appear
  * Load ide-generic if not already loaded when an ide device is detected.

  * Rule changes:
    - Change group of USB and IEEE1394 block devices to plugdev and change

    - udev daemon is now run on startup, rather than first event
    - events are received exclusively over the netlink socket, you should
      leave /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug empty from now on.
    - events with a TIMEOUT are now processed immediately
    - disks can now be accessed through /dev/disk/by-label/ and
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/ if you know what disk you're looking for, but not
      what kernel-assigned name it has.
    - device nodes with default name and no symlink are no longer stored in
      the udevdb.
    - the "udev_db" option has been removed, and the udevdb moved to
      /dev/.udev/db
    - when there are queued events, /dev/.udev/queue will exist and contain
      symlinks to the appropriate /sys paths for each event
    - exit status of programs called by RUN rules is now tracked
    - if an event fails, /dev/.udev/failed will exist and contain symlinks
      to the appropriate /sys paths; this can be used to replay failed events
      later
    - rules with NAME="" will cause no device node to be created, but RUN
      keys will still be run.  Use OPTION "ignore_device" to completely
      ignore an event.
    - added WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="<attribute>" key to rule syntax, all built-in
      logic to work around timing has been removed and instead this rule
      should be used where necessary
    - syntax to test for existance of environment variable changed from

    it makes sense to just maintain our own package now.  Ironically this
    makes it easier to send patches back as we don't have to strip out the
    "back out stuff" hunks first.
  * Completely replaces the functionality of the hotplug package, which will
    be removed by installing this.  If you had custom /etc/hotplug.d or
    /etc/dev.d scripts, you will need to update those to be called by a udev
    rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/8?-*.rules
  * Depends on grepmap directly for the last remaining subsystems that don't
    produce MODALIAS variables, rather than indirectly using the old hotplug
    agents.
  * Provides its own initramfs-tools hook and scripts, replacing the /dev
    functionality that used to be built into it.

  * The plain udev binary and udevstart are no longer shipped; all events are
    received over the netlink socket by udevd and processed internally.  The
    general functionality of udevstart has been replaced by udevplug.
  * /etc/udev/links.conf is gone and instead replaced by the /lib/udev/devices
    directory.  If you need any extra device nodes, symlinks or placed in
    /dev on boot just place them here; they're copied over when the system
    starts.
  * The udev_root and udev_rules config options have been removed, if you
    really want to change these, you can; but beware that you'll need to
    change a lot of other things too -- they were just too difficult to
    reliably support when combined with initramfs.
  * All scripts removed from /etc/udev/scripts, instead replacements (often
    binaries for speed) are shipped in /lib/udev; you can replace them by
    adding your own and adjusting the rules.

  * All rules are now placed directly in /etc/udev/rules.d, rather than
    symlinking them in.
  * All of the default rules have been replaced with new rules; if you had
    modified the old ones they will be disabled but left in /etc/udev for
    you (with a .dpkg-bak name).  You'll need to update your rules for the
    new system, and place them in a new /etc/udev/rules.d/50-*.rules file.

udev (0.060-1ubuntu15) breezy; urgency=low

  * The kernel's input subsystem still hasn't been updated to use the new
    driver core and is still running /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug (udevsend)
    itself with a hand-constructed environment, rather than attaching data
    to the sysfs event.

    These hand-constructed events are missing the DEVPATH= variable which
    udev requires before processing its rules.

    Added debian/patches/hotplug_input_events which instead of ignoring these
    events catches those from the input subsystem and processes them by
    running /sbin/udev_run_hotplugd; effectively passing all responsibility
    to the old hotplug input.agent which still can deal with them.

    In the long-term, the kernel will be updated to use the driver core
    (there are patches starting to be floated now) and attach its
    information to the sysfs event, so this hack can go when that happens.

udev (0.060-1ubuntu14) breezy; urgency=low

  * Well, that didn't work so well now, did it folks?

    Looks like good old Mr Kernel is _only_ sending some events down the
    netlink socket, and we really don't want to be ignoring them.

    Revert the ubuntu13 change, and instead start udevd manually at
    S04udev.  This isn't as much of a hack as it first appears, because
    once /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug goes away we'll need to do this anyway.
