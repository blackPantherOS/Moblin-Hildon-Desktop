Overview
--------

Moblin-games is based off of gnome-games, a collection of simple, 
but addictive, games from the GNOME desktop.  Moblin games extends these
games to be finger friendly and optimized for mobile internet devices.  
They are meant to be the sort of game that can be played in five minutes or so. They are
also meant to be fun enough that you will play them again and
again. Of course we can't be held responsible for the time and
productivity lost while playing them.

The Games
---------

Here is a list of the games in this compilation along with a brief
description. The names in brackets are the program names you use from the

Mailing List
------------

moblin-games has a mailing list at <dev@moblin.org>. You can
subscribe to the list at:

 https://www.moblin.org/mailman/listinfo/dev

and browse the archives at:

The mailing list is for announcements and discussion about moblin 
development.

Maintainers
-----------

The current maintainers for moblin-games are:

 Danny Varner <danny.varner@intel.com>
 Bob Spencer <bob.spencer@intel.com>

While you can email them with suggestions and bug reports it is better
to use either the bug tracking system (see below) or the mailing
list. Even for suggestions the bug tracking system is better because
it ensures that there is an archive of the discussion and it is harder
for the maintainer to loose suggestions. For more general discussion,
policy issues and issues that many people will be interested in, the
mailing list is the best place.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you find any bugs in moblin-games, or even just have a suggestion
for an improvement to the games then please submit a bug report.

about contributing to moblin-games.


Requirements
------------

This is the list of required software packages for moblin-games:

 - Hildon
 - GTK+ 2.8.0
 - GNOME Doc Utils - gnome-doc-utils 0.10.0
 - GNOME Python Desktop - gnome-python-desktop 2.17.3  (python-gnome2)
 - gnome-python2-gnomeprint
 - RSVG 2.14.0
 - Guile 1.8.0
 - GStreamer 0.10.11
 - Python 2.4 
 - PyGTK - python-gtk2-dev 2.10.0 
 - libxml 2.4.0

These packages are optional, but highly recommended:

 - gtkglext 1.2.0 , pygtkglext 1.1.0 and pyopengl 2.0

GStreamer 0.10 is required by moblin-games, and is used to play sounds.

CVS checkouts will require the latest intltool.

In addition it is useful to have a working C++ compiler (e.g. g++,
part of the gcc suite) and the guile implementation of the Scheme
programming language version 1.6 or later
(http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html). If either of these is
missing then the games that rely on them will simply not be built.


Building Moblin-Games
--------------------

Moblin-games uses the GNU automake system and installation may be as
easy as:

$ ./configure
$ make install

Generic, but detailed, instructions can be found in the file INSTALL.

There are several moblin-games specific options you can pass to
configure. These security related options are:

--disable-setgid                Do not set the setgid bit on the
                                installed binaries.
--with-scores-group=group       If you are using setgid binaries, set
                                the group for the programs. The
                                default is games.
--with-scores-user=user         If you are using setgid binaries, set
                                the user for the programs. The default
                                is games.

For a discussion of the details behind these options and why you might
want to change them see the "Security" section. In general you will
not need to change any of them.

To select which games to compile use --enable-omitgames and
--enable-games. Each option takes a comma separated list of directory
names (not the screen-names of the games). "all" is also a valid
name. For example:

./configure  --enable-omitgames=aisleriot

would compile all the games except aisleriot.

./configure --enable-games=aisleriot

would compile just aisleriot

Use './configure --help' for a complete list of currently supported
options and environment variables.


The Future
----------
We are always looking for more games to be ported/created for a MID.  
Visit the How-tos on http://www.moblin.org for more information on 
how to optimize a game for moblin.
