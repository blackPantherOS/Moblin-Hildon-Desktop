How to compile AisleRiot on different platforms
===============================================

The AilseRiot code supports different platforms: GNOME, GTK only and Maemo.
To compile it for some platform, configure GNOME Games with

    ./configure --with-platform=gnome
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=gtk-only --with-games=aisleriot
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=maemo --with-games=aisleriot

For GNOME and GTK-only, you can just install and run AisleRiot as normal.
Please refer to the scratchbox documentation about how to run AilseRiot in
scratchbox for the Maemo platform.


Notes about Maemo environment
=============================

On maemo the programme is started using DBUS service files;
org.gnome.Games.AisleRiot.service.in is our service file.
aisleriot-backup.conf is used to backup the programme's setting
using the device's backup manager, and aisleriot-clean.sh is used
to clean the setting on uninstall.


Environment variables
=====================

You can set the following environment variables to influence the
behaviour of AisleRiot:

GAMES_CARDS_SUBRENDERING:
  Values: 0 or 1
  Default: 1
  
    Set to 1 to use librsvg's subrendering which speeds up
  the card rendering in case we don't need them all at once.
  Needs support from the cards svg in form of special node IDs.
  Set to 0 to suppress subrendering.

AISLERIOT_CARDS_SCALABLE:
  Values: 0 or 1
  Default: 1 (maemo: 0)

    Set to 0 to use prerendered cards; to 1 to use scalable cards.

AISLERIOT_PIXBUF_DRAWING:
  Values: 0 or 1
  Default: 1 (maemo: 0)
  
    Set to 0 to disable pixbuf drawing and use pixmap drawing instead. Pixbuf
  drawing has the benefit of using full alphachannels, eliminating ugly
  rendering artifacts caused by the 1-bit alphachannels of the pixmaps.
  Might be a bit slower though.
